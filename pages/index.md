# Welcome!

Welcome to the official website of **Serum**, a simple static website generator!

## What is Serum?

**Serum** is a static website generator written in [Elixir Programming
Language](http://elixir-lang.org). The goal of this project is to provide the
way to create awesome static websites with _little_ effort.

Serum focuses on blogging. It's capable of handling tags and automatically
generating lists of blog posts. But it's still a good choice for creating
simple, general purpose, static websites.

It also supports plugins and themes. Plugins extend the functionality of Serum
and add more awesomeness to your website. Themes are good ways to quickly setup
the overall look and feel of your website.
