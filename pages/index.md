# Welcome

Welcome to the official website of **Serum**, a simple static website generator!

## What is Serum?

**Serum** is yet another static website generator written in [Elixir Programming
Language](http://elixir-lang.org). The goal of this project is to provide the
way to create awesome static websites with _little_ effort.

## Getting Started

Feeling interested? If you want to try Serum, please read the [Getting Started
Guide](%pages:getting-started).

## Contribution

I am quite new to Elixir and OTP, and I started this project to make use of my
studies while learning the language and techniques. So this project will grow
bigger and _better_ as I learn the new things. If you have any suggestions or
any ideas on improvements, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request
on [GitHub](https://github.com/Dalgona/Serum).
