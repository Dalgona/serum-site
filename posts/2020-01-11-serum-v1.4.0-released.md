The new Serum v1 release includes the following new features and changes. These
changes will also be included to the upcoming v2 releases.

## Added

- Added `open` command to the Serum development server CLI. This command opens
  your website in the default web browser of your desktop environment. Special
  thanks to **[@nallwhy](https://github.com/nallwhy)**!
- Users can now configure the `Serum.Plugins.SitemapGenerator` plugin so that
  it generates entries for pages, posts, or both.

  [Read the documentation](%page:docs/plugin/sitemap) to learn more about the
  new `:for` option.

## Changed

- The `Serum.Plugins.SitemapGenerator` plugin no longer generates `robots.txt`
  file. Create and put your own `robots.txt` to your `files/` directory.
