While I am spending most of the Serum development time for "Serum v2" works, I
would like to announce a new maintenance release of Serum v1.x: Serum v1.4.1.

## Improved

- Upgraded Floki, the HTML parser library, to 0.26.0, which provides more
  useful functionalities Serum needs.
- Updated some codes that may not work well with the latest version of Floki.
  These codes were causing some noisy warnings during website builds for some
  users, but this issuse is now fixed.

**If you are recently getting a bunch of deprecation warnings, please upgrade
Serum to v1.4.1!**

For those who have been waiting for a big update, I'm sorry. But like I said at
the beginning, I have been working on the "Serum v2" project, and this is going
to be a _huge_ one, with many enhancements, many new features, but also with
many breaking changes.

In the meantime, there will be some more of minor bug fixes and stability
improvements for Serum v1, like this. And I'm also planning to write posts
about what to expect in Serum v2, one topic at a time. So please stay tuned!
