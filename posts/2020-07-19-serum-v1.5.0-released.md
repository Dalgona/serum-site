Since the first release of "Serum v2" is greatly delayed, I am going to release
a few more versions of Serum v1. As an apology for such delay, these releases
will include some new features backported from the upcoming "Serum v2" project.

Here's the changelog for Serum v1.5.0:

### Added

- Added 3 new configuration items for your
  [Serum project (`serum.exs`)](%page:docs/project-definition), which can be
  used to customize locations for your blog-related pages:

    - `:posts_source` (string, optional) - Path to a directory which holds
      source files for your blog posts. Defaults to `"posts"`.

    - `:posts_path` (string, optional) - Path in a output directory which your
      rendered blog posts will be written to. Defaults to the value of
      `:posts_source`. (i.e. the default value will be `"posts"` if the value
      of `:posts_source` is not explicitly given.)

    - `:tags_path` (string, optional) - Path in an output directory which the
      tag pages will be written to. Defaults to `"tags"`.

- Added a new Serum plugin: `Serum.Plugins.PreviewGenerator`.

  This plugin is a replacement of the built-in preview text generation
  functionality. Unlike the built-in preview generator, this new plugin can
  generate preview texts not only for blog posts, but also for regular pages.

  [Read the documentation](%page:docs/plugin/preview) to learn more about
  this plugin.
